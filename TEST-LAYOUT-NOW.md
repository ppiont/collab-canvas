# Test Layout Tools NOW

**Status:** Debug logging added, ready to diagnose

---

## üß™ Test This Right Now:

1. **Keep your 3 circles** (don't recreate)

2. **Press Cmd+K**

3. **Type:** "Arrange these shapes vertically"

4. **Watch the console** - You should now see detailed logs:
   ```
   [AI Tool Execution] arrangeHorizontal/arrangeVertical {...}
   [Layout] arrangeHorizontal - IDs: [...]
   [Layout] Found X shapes: [...]
   [Layout] Starting at X: ... Y: ... Spacing: ...
   [Layout] Shape 0 - ID: ... Moving to X: ... Y: ...
   [Layout] Shape 1 - ID: ... Moving to X: ... Y: ...
   [Layout] arrangeHorizontal complete
   ```

## üîç **What to Look For:**

**If you see:**
- `[Layout] Found 0 shapes` ‚Üí shapeOperations.get() is failing
- `[Layout] Found 3 shapes` ‚Üí Good, shapes found
- `[Layout] Shape 0 - Moving to X:...` ‚Üí It's calling update
- But shapes don't move ‚Üí Update isn't syncing to Yjs properly

**Then share:**
- The full `[Layout]` log output
- I'll debug why shapeOperations.update() isn't working

## ‚ö° Quick Question:

**Did the circles move at all, or stay exactly where they were?**

If they moved even slightly, the update is working but positions might be wrong.  
If they didn't move at all, the update isn't applying.
