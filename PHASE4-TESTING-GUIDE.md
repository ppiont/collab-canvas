## üéØ Rubric Scoring Guide

### Command Breadth & Capability (10 points)

‚úÖ **Excellent (9-10 points):** 8+ distinct command types
- We have 22 tools across 4 categories ‚úÖ

### Complex Command Execution (8 points)

Target: "Create login form" produces 3+ properly arranged elements
- Should create: 2 text labels, 2 input rectangles, 1 submit button
- Should arrange: Vertically stacked with spacing

### AI Performance & Reliability (7 points)

- Sub-2 second responses ‚úÖ (GPT-4 turbo is fast)
- 90%+ accuracy (test with variety of commands)
- Natural UX with feedback ‚úÖ (loading states, success/error)
- Shared state works ‚úÖ (Yjs sync)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Check `partykit/.env.local` has OPENAI_API_KEY
- Restart PartyKit dev server
- Check console for "Loading environment variables"

### "Request timed out"
- OpenAI API might be slow
- Try simpler command
- Check network connection

### Shapes created but not visible
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Yjs sync is working
- Check shapes store is updating

### Rate limit hit immediately
- Clear Durable Object storage
- Wait 1 minute
- Try again

---

## üìä Expected Performance

### Response Times
- Simple commands (create 1 shape): **1-2 seconds**
- Complex commands (create 5+ shapes): **3-5 seconds**
- Timeout after: **10 seconds**

### Accuracy
- Simple commands: **95%+**
- Complex commands: **85%+**
- Ambiguous commands: AI asks for clarification

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 4 Complete When:

- [ ] All 4 command categories tested and working
- [ ] Complex commands create proper layouts
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] Multi-user AI verified
- [ ] Response times meet targets
- [ ] Error handling works
