# Task ID: 8
# Title: HIGH: Optimize Render Effect Array Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high

# Details:
**File:** `src/routes/canvas/+page.svelte:257-288`

**Problem:** Multiple expensive array operations on every render (1500+ operations with 500 shapes)

**Steps:**

**Impact:** 60-80% faster render updates
