# Task ID: 1
# Title: CRITICAL: Fix Infinite requestAnimationFrame Loop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix severe performance bug in LiveShapeRenderer causing 100% CPU usage
# Details:
**File:** `src/lib/canvas/collaboration/LiveShapeRenderer.ts:61-66`

**Problem:** Infinite `requestAnimationFrame` loop that does nothing, causing severe CPU drain.

**Steps:**
1. Delete the entire `scheduleUpdates()` method (lines 61-66)
2. Remove the call to `this.scheduleUpdates()` from constructor (line 42)
3. The awareness 'change' listener already triggers updates on-demand

**Impact:** 20-30% CPU usage reduction, better battery life
