# Task ID: 28
# Title: LOW: Document Store vs Runes Decision
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Add JSDoc comments explaining why Svelte stores are kept vs migrating to runes
# Details:
**Files:** All files in `src/lib/stores/`

**Add Documentation:**
```typescript
/**
 * Global shapes store (read-only, synced from Yjs)
 * 
 * NOTE: Using Svelte 4 stores instead of runes because:
 * 1. Global state shared across many components
 * 2. Yjs integration requires stable reference
 * 3. Store pattern provides consistent API for subscriptions
 * 
 * This is an acceptable pattern for global singleton state.
 */
export const shapes = writable<Shape[]>([]);
```

**Impact:** Clarity for future developers
