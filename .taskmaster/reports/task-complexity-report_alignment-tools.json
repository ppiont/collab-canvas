			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create alignment utility functions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of alignment utility functions into subtasks for: 1) bounding box calculation with rotation support, 2) alignment operations (left, center, right, top, middle, bottom), and 3) distribution operations (horizontal, vertical). For each subtask, include implementation details, edge cases to handle, and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-high complexity because it requires implementing core mathematical functions that handle various shape types, rotations, and positioning. The utility functions need to account for different coordinate systems (center vs. corner positioning) and handle rotation correctly. The implementation requires deep understanding of Konva's API, particularly getClientRect(). The code must be robust to handle edge cases like shapes with the same position. The comprehensive test strategy also indicates complexity."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create AlignmentSection component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AlignmentSection component implementation into subtasks for: 1) UI layout and styling with grid of alignment buttons and icons, and 2) event handling and integration with alignment utility functions. For each subtask, include implementation details, component structure, and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves creating a Svelte component with a grid layout of buttons, icons, and tooltips. The component needs to handle click events and integrate with the alignment utility functions. While the UI implementation is straightforward, the component needs to properly handle conditional logic (e.g., not attempting alignment with fewer than 2 shapes). The testing requirements include component tests, interaction tests, and accessibility testing, but the overall implementation is well-defined with provided code examples."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AlignmentSection into Properties Panel",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of AlignmentSection into the Properties Panel into steps for importing the component, adding conditional rendering logic, implementing the accordion UI, and passing the necessary props.",
			"reasoning": "This task has low complexity as it primarily involves modifying an existing component to include the new AlignmentSection. The implementation is straightforward: import the component, add conditional rendering logic, and pass the necessary props. The code example provided is clear and comprehensive. The testing requirements are also straightforward, focusing on verifying the conditional rendering and accordion behavior. This is essentially an integration task that doesn't require complex logic or extensive modifications."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement horizontal alignment operations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of horizontal alignment operations into subtasks for: 1) left alignment implementation with rotation support, 2) center horizontal alignment implementation with rotation support, and 3) right alignment implementation with rotation support. For each subtask, include detailed algorithm steps, edge cases to handle, and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-high complexity because it requires implementing specific alignment algorithms that must handle shape rotation and center offsets correctly. Each alignment function needs to calculate target positions based on the collective bounding box and then adjust individual shapes while maintaining their vertical positions. The implementation must account for the difference between a shape's position properties and its visual bounds when rotated. The comprehensive test strategy, including tests for rotated shapes and edge cases, indicates significant complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement vertical alignment operations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of vertical alignment operations into subtasks for: 1) top alignment implementation with rotation support, 2) middle vertical alignment implementation with rotation support, and 3) bottom alignment implementation with rotation support. For each subtask, include detailed algorithm steps, edge cases to handle, and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-high complexity similar to Task 4, as it requires implementing vertical alignment algorithms with the same challenges regarding rotation and offsets. The vertical alignment functions need to calculate target positions based on the collective bounding box and adjust individual shapes while maintaining their horizontal positions. The implementation must handle the same complexities regarding shape rotation and the difference between position properties and visual bounds. The testing requirements are equally comprehensive."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement distribution operations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of distribution operations into subtasks for: 1) horizontal distribution with support for different shape sizes and rotations, and 2) vertical distribution with support for different shape sizes and rotations. For each subtask, include detailed algorithm steps, sorting logic, spacing calculations, edge cases to handle, and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity because distribution operations are algorithmically more complex than simple alignment. The functions need to sort shapes by position, calculate the total available space, and distribute shapes evenly while maintaining their order. The implementation must handle shapes of different sizes and rotations correctly, and calculate center points accurately. The distribution must work with as few as 2 shapes and maintain the positions of the first and last shapes. The comprehensive test strategy, including tests for different numbers of shapes and rotation values, indicates significant complexity."
