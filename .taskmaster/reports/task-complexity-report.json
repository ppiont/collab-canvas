			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Create alignment utility functions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of alignment utility functions into subtasks focusing on: 1) Core bounding box calculation function, 2) Basic alignment functions (left, center, right, top, middle, bottom), and 3) Distribution functions (horizontal and vertical). For each subtask, consider edge cases, shape rotation handling, and proper type definitions.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-to-high complexity because it requires implementing 9 utility functions that must handle various shape types, rotations, and positioning calculations. The functions need to work with Konva's API and handle geometric calculations correctly. The implementation must account for different shape types and rotation, which adds complexity. The task requires careful consideration of edge cases and proper type definitions. The example implementation provides guidance but implementing all functions with proper error handling and edge cases will require significant effort."

			"taskId": 35,
			"taskTitle": "Create AlignmentSection Svelte component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AlignmentSection Svelte component implementation into subtasks focusing on: 1) UI implementation with grid layout and proper styling, and 2) Event handling and integration with alignment utility functions. Consider accessibility, responsive design, and proper state management.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves creating a Svelte component with a grid layout of buttons and tooltips. The component needs to integrate with the alignment utility functions from task 34. Most of the implementation is already provided in the details, including the component structure, styling, and event handling. The main challenges are ensuring proper integration with the alignment utilities and implementing all 8 buttons with appropriate handlers. The task is dependent on task 34 being completed first."

			"taskId": 36,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AlignmentSection into Properties Panel",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No subtasks needed as this is a straightforward integration task.",
			"reasoning": "This task has low complexity as it simply involves integrating the AlignmentSection component into an existing PropertiesPanel component. The implementation details are clearly specified, including the code changes needed. The task requires adding an import statement, a conditional check, and an accordion item. The main challenge is ensuring the component is only shown when 2 or more shapes are selected, but this is a simple reactive statement in Svelte. The task is dependent on task 35 being completed first."

		{
			"taskId": 37,
			"taskTitle": "Implement distribution algorithms",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the distribution algorithms implementation into subtasks focusing on: 1) Horizontal distribution algorithm with proper sorting, spacing calculation, and position updates, and 2) Vertical distribution algorithm with similar considerations. For each subtask, consider edge cases, shape rotation handling, and proper type definitions.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves implementing distribution algorithms for horizontal and vertical spacing. The algorithms need to sort shapes by position, calculate available space, and distribute shapes evenly while maintaining their original dimensions and other positions. The implementation requires careful handling of shape centers vs. edges, and proper calculation of new positions. The example code provides guidance for the horizontal distribution, but implementing both algorithms with proper error handling and edge cases will require significant effort. The task is dependent on task 34 being completed first."

		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "Handle edge cases and optimize performance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the edge case handling and performance optimization into subtasks focusing on: 1) Rotated shape handling, 2) Different shape type support, 3) Performance optimization with memoization and batch updates, and 4) Edge case handling for special situations. For each subtask, consider implementation details, testing strategies, and integration with existing code.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves addressing multiple edge cases and optimizing performance for the alignment utility functions. The task requires implementing memoization for expensive calculations, batch updates for multiple shapes, and handling various edge cases like rotated shapes, different shape types, and shapes with the same position. The implementation needs to be thoroughly tested with performance benchmarks. The optimizations must be carefully integrated with the existing alignment functions without introducing bugs. The task is dependent on both task 34 and task 37 being completed first."
