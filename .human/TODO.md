- Fix canvas. Make the grid "infinity", or make it impossible to drag beyond the grid (into white) by having an elastic bounce-back effect at the edge.
- Put Shape toolbox at bottom
- Make Shape toolbox actually pretty
- Make Properties Panel actually pretty (investigate if something went wrong when initializing shadcn (all of our components are bland as hell)
- Make collaborator cursors pretty
- Make user cursor behave properly. E.g. after deselecting a shape, it changes to hand shape (should only be shown when holding down Space to pan)
- Create a popup to view shortcuts
- Make off-screen collaborator cursors off-screen indicator not hide behind panels/components/toolboxes. They should stay on the "inside".
- Do a proper "line" implementaton.
- Fix text editing
- Layers (z-order?)
- Fix dimension changing while rotating
