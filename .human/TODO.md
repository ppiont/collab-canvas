# TODO
- Fix canvas. Make the grid "infinity", or make it impossible to drag beyond the grid (into white) by having an elastic bounce-back effect at the edge.
- Make Properties Panel actually pretty (investigate if something went wrong when initializing shadcn (all of our components are bland as hell)
- Make collaborator cursors pretty
- Make off-screen collaborator cursors off-screen indicator not hide behind panels/components/toolboxes. They should stay on the "inside".
- Fix dimension changing while rotating
