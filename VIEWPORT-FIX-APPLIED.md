# Viewport-Aware AI Shape Creation - Applied âœ…

**Status:** Implemented, ready to test  
**Impact:** Much better UX - shapes appear where user is looking

---

## âœ… What I Just Fixed

### The Problem:

- AI was creating shapes at hardcoded center (400, 300)
- User might be zoomed in or panned somewhere else
- Shapes appeared off-screen

### The Solution:

1. **Pass current viewport to AI** (pan position + zoom level)
2. **Calculate visible center** in canvas coordinates
3. **Send to GPT-4** in the context message
4. **GPT-4 creates shapes** at the visible center

---

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

**Files Modified:**

1. `src/routes/canvas/+page.svelte` - Pass viewport to CommandPalette
2. `src/lib/components/CommandPalette.svelte` - Calculate visible center, send to backend
3. `partykit/server.ts` - Receive viewport, include in GPT-4 prompt
4. `partykit/ai/prompts.ts` - Tell GPT-4 to use viewport center

**Math:**

```typescript
// Converts screen position to canvas coordinates
visibleCenterX = (-viewport.x + stageWidth / 2) / viewport.scale;
visibleCenterY = (-viewport.y + stageHeight / 2) / viewport.scale;
```

## ðŸ§ª Test It Now

### Test 1: Shapes Appear in View

1. **Pan to a random area** (drag the canvas around)
2. **Zoom in** (scroll wheel)
3. **Press Cmd+K**
4. **Type:** "Create a red circle"
5. **Verify:** Circle appears in the center of YOUR VIEW (not at fixed position) âœ…

### Test 2: After Panning Far Away

1. **Pan really far** (like to position x: -2000, y: -1500)
2. **Press Cmd+K**
3. **Type:** "Create 3 blue rectangles"
4. **Verify:** Rectangles appear where you are, not at (400, 300) âœ…

### Test 3: Complex Command in Custom View

1. **Pan to a nice spot**
2. **Zoom to comfortable level**
3. **Press Cmd+K**
4. **Type:** "Create a login form"
5. **Verify:** Login form appears in your current view âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Console Output to Watch For:

```
[AI] Current viewport: {x: -1234, y: -567, scale: 1.5}
[AI] Visible center: 850 420
[PartyKit] Viewport: {centerX: 850, centerY: 420, zoom: 1.5, ...}
```

Then in the GPT-4 context:

```
VIEWPORT INFO (user's visible area):
- Visible center: (850, 420)
- Zoom level: 150%
...
IMPORTANT: Create new shapes near the visible center (850, 420)
```

## âœ… Expected Behavior

**Before:**

- Create circle â†’ appears at (400, 300) always
- User panned away â†’ can't see new shape
- User has to pan back to find it

**After:**

- Create circle â†’ appears at visible center
- User can immediately see it
- Much better UX! âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ Next: Test Complex Commands

Now that shapes appear in viewport, test the rubric-critical commands:

1. **"Create a login form"**
   - Should appear in your current view
   - Should be properly laid out
2. **"Build a navigation bar with Home, About, Services, Contact"**
   - Should appear where you're looking
   - Horizontal layout

3. **"Create a 3x3 grid of blue circles"**
   - Should be in view
   - Grid pattern

These are the commands that will be in the demo video, so make sure they work!

**Status:** âœ… Viewport awareness implemented  
**Test:** Try creating shapes after panning/zooming  
**Next:** Test complex commands for rubric
