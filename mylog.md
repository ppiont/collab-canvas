Asked Claude for PRD based on collab canvas project assignment doc.
- validated PRD with claude, went through clarifications on technology choices and non-function requirements.

Decided with Claude to skip user stories as requirements are very clear already
- made a checklist with tasks corresponding to deployable PRs
