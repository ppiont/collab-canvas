## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Session 1: Delete Zombie Files & Backward Compatibility (30 min)
- ✅ Deleted `src/lib/stores/rectangles.ts` (74 lines)
- ✅ Deleted `src/lib/types.ts` (35 lines)
- ✅ Removed all backward compatibility exports from:
  - `stores/shapes.ts` (4 lines)
  - `stores/index.ts` (4 lines)
  - `collaboration.ts` (4 lines)
- ✅ Fixed reference: `rectanglesMap` → `shapesMap`

**Result:** 109 lines deleted + 12 lines cleaned

---

### Session 2: Implement ShapeFactory Usage (20 min)
- ✅ Imported `ShapeFactory` in canvas component
- ✅ Replaced 73-line switch statement with ShapeFactory.create()
- ✅ Reduced shape creation logic from 73 → 26 lines
- ✅ Verified all 8 shape types work

**Result:** 47 lines saved, 100% ShapeFactory usage

---

### Session 3: Remove Console Logs (20 min)
- ✅ Removed 12 console.logs from canvas component
- ✅ Removed 6 from ShapeRenderer
- ✅ Removed 6 from stores/shapes.ts
- ✅ Removed 5 from stores (tool.ts, history.ts)
- ✅ Removed 4 from collaboration.ts
- ✅ Removed 4 from CursorManager & CanvasEngine

**Result:** 30+ console.logs removed (0 remain)

---

### Session 4: Fix Type Safety Issues (15 min)
- ✅ Added `broadcastCurrentPosition()` method to CursorManager
- ✅ Replaced 3 `{} as any` casts with proper method call
- ✅ Fixed type assertion in shapes.ts (documented as justified)
- ✅ Zero linter errors

**Result:** All critical type safety issues fixed

---

### Session 5: Extract Event Handlers (30 min)
- ✅ Created `src/lib/canvas/core/EventHandlers.ts` (197 lines)
- ✅ Extracted 136 lines of event handler code from canvas component
- ✅ Proper cleanup and lifecycle management
- ✅ Canvas component: 447 → 284 lines

**Result:** Canvas component 36% smaller, properly modular

---

### Session 6: Final Verification (15 min)
- ✅ Zero linter errors
- ✅ Zero console.log statements
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ All 8 shape types create/render correctly
- ✅ **Critical fix:** Closure capture bug in isCreateMode callback
  - Was capturing initial `false` value
  - Now reads fresh value from `$isCreateToolActive` store
- ✅ All features working

**Result:** Production ready ✅

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixed During Cleanup

### Shape Creation Closure Bug
**Problem:** `isCreateMode` callback was capturing the initial value (`false`) at initialization time instead of reading the current value.

**Symptom:** Shapes created by ShapeFactory but never rendered on canvas.

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// BROKEN - captures initial value
() => isCreateMode

// FIXED - reads fresh value
() => $isCreateToolActive
```

**Solution:** Changed closure to read from the store directly on each invocation.

**Impact:** Shape creation now works flawlessly for all 8 types.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Systematic approach** - 6 sessions, each with clear goals
2. **Build verification** - Tested after each major change
3. **Root cause analysis** - Found closure capture bug through debugging
4. **ShapeFactory integration** - Saved 47 lines, improved maintainability

### What We Fixed 🔧
1. **Zombie code** - Deleted obsolete files immediately
2. **Duplicate code** - Single source of truth for `getAllShapes()`
3. **Debug pollution** - Removed all development logging
4. **Type safety** - Proper method signatures, no unsafe casts
5. **Modularity** - Event handlers in separate class
6. **Closure bug** - Reactive store access, not captured values

### For Future Phases 📚
1. ✅ **Delete immediately** - Don't keep "backward compatibility" cruft
2. ✅ **Use abstractions** - If you build ShapeFactory, use it everywhere
3. ✅ **Clean before commit** - Remove debug code before PR
4. ✅ **Test reactive closures** - Use store subscriptions, not captured values
5. ✅ **Measure progress** - 284 lines (verified) vs "290 lines" (estimate)
