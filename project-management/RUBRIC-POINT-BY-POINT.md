---

## Section 3: Advanced Figma-Inspired Features (15 points)

### Tier 1 Features (2 points each, max 3 features = 6 points)

#### ✅ Color picker with recent colors/saved palettes

- [ ] **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Evidence: PropertiesPanel uses basic `<input type="color">`
- No recent colors tracking
- No Material Design palette

- [x] **IMPLEMENTED** ✅ **+2 points**
- Evidence: src/routes/canvas/+page.svelte:366-376
- Undo: Cmd+Z working
- Redo: Cmd+Shift+Z or Cmd+Y working

#### Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

- [x] **IMPLEMENTED** ✅ **+2 points**
- Evidence: src/routes/canvas/+page.svelte:333-360
- Cmd+C, Cmd+V working
- src/lib/stores/clipboard.ts exists

**Tier 1 Total: 5 / 6 points** (2.5 features implemented)

---

### Tier 2 Features (3 points each, max 2 features = 6 points)

#### ❌ Component system (create reusable components/symbols)

- [ ] **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

#### ❌ Layers panel with drag-to-reorder and hierarchy

- [ ] **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Evidence: No LayersPanel.svelte component found
- LayerManager.ts exists but no UI

#### ❌ Alignment tools (align left/right/center, distribute evenly)

- [ ] **NOT IMPLEMENTED AS UI**
- AI has alignment commands BUT line 176 says "TODO: Implement layout tools"
- NO UI buttons for manual alignment

#### ⚠️ Z-index management (bring to front, send to back)

- [ ] **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** ⚠️ **+1.5 points**
- LayerManager.ts has methods (bringToFront, sendToBack, etc.)
- BUT NO keyboard shortcuts wired up (no Cmd+], Cmd+[ found)
- BUT NO UI buttons
- BUT DOES sort shapes by z-index in rendering (ShapeRenderer.ts:171)
- User CAN change z-index via PropertiesPanel? Let me check...

Actually, z-index just works via drag ordering (dragging brings to top). That's BASIC functionality, not full "management". **+0 points** for Tier 2 unless there are explicit controls.

#### ❌ Selection tools (lasso select, select all of type)

- [ ] **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Has: Drag-net (marquee) selection ✅

   - ❌ Query tools: NOT IMPLEMENTED

3. **Complex Commands Will Fail:**
   - "Create login form" needs arrangeVertical
   - "Build navigation bar" needs arrangeHorizontal
   - "Make card layout" needs multiple layout operations
   - **All will fail due to TODO on line 176**

**Testing Status:**

   - Evidence: EventHandlers.ts has NO tool shortcuts
   - Toolbar shows shortcuts in tooltips but they don't work!

3. **Duplicate Shortcut (Cmd+D)**
   - Claimed: Working
   - Reality: NOT FOUND
   - Evidence: No Cmd+D handler found

4. **Layer Management Shortcuts (Cmd+], Cmd+[, etc.)**
   - Claimed: Working
   - Reality: NOT FOUND
   - Evidence: EventHandlers.ts has NO bracket key handlers
   - LayerManager methods exist but not wired to keyboard

5. **Arrow Keys to Move Shapes**
   - Claimed: Working
   - Reality: NOT FOUND

### ❌ Missing UI Features

6. **Text Formatting Buttons** (bold/italic/underline)
   - Types defined, NO UI buttons
7. **Layer Management Panel** or any layer UI
   - LayerManager.ts exists, NO UI component

8. **Alignment Tool Buttons**
   - AI can align, NO UI buttons

9. **Color Picker with Presets**
   - Just basic `<input type="color">`

10. **Shadow Controls**
    - Types defined, NO UI

11. **Blend Mode Selector**
    - Types defined, NO UI

12. **Export Functionality**
    - Completely absent

## WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS (Verified)

### ✅ Confirmed Working

1. Create shapes (8 types via toolbar click)
2. Move shapes (drag and drop)
3. Resize shapes (transformer handles)
4. Rotate shapes (transformer rotation handle)
5. Delete shapes (Delete/Backspace key)
6. Multi-select (Shift+click, drag-net)
7. Copy/paste (Cmd+C, Cmd+V)
8. Undo/redo (Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z)
9. Real-time sync (2-3 users works smoothly)
10. Multiplayer cursors (smooth, name labels)
11. AI simple commands (create shapes, move, color)
12. PropertiesPanel (basic editing: position, size, color, opacity, rotation, fontSize)

### ❌ Claimed But NOT Working

1. Tool selection keyboard shortcuts (V, R, C, T, L, P, S)
2. Duplicate keyboard shortcut (Cmd+D)
3. Layer keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+], Cmd+[, etc.)
4. Arrow keys to nudge shapes
5. AI layout commands (arrangeHorizontal, etc.)
6. AI complex commands (login form, nav bar, card)
7. Text formatting buttons
8. Layer management UI
9. Alignment tool buttons
10. Export (PNG/SVG)
11. Color picker with presets
12. Shadow controls
13. Blend mode controls
14. Scale performance (500+ shapes)
15. Multi-user scale (5+ users)

## REALISTIC SCORING

### Current State (As-Is)

- **Base Points:** 61-71 points
- **AI Dev Log:** Incomplete (potential FAIL)
- **Demo Video:** Missing (-10 points)
- **Current Grade:** **41-61 points (F to D)**

### With Critical Bug Fixes (1 day)

**Fix:** Implement layout tools client-side
**Fix:** Wire up keyboard shortcuts (tools, duplicate, layers)

- **Base Points:** 70-78 points
- **With Log:** Pass
- **With Video:** 60-68 points
- **Grade:** D to D+

### With Bug Fixes + Testing (1 week)

**Fix:** All bugs above
**Do:** Scale testing, AI command testing

- **Base Points:** 75-82 points
- **With Log:** Pass
- **With Video:** 65-72 points
- **Grade:** D+ to C

### With Full Implementation (2-3 weeks)

**Add:** Export, color picker, more keyboard shortcuts
**Add:** More Tier 1/2 features
**Do:** Comprehensive testing

- **Base Points:** 85-92 points
- **With Log:** Pass
- **With Video:** 75-82 points
- **Grade:** C to B-

---

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Critical Path)

### Must Fix (2-3 days)

1. **Implement AI layout tools client-side** (2-3 hours)
   - File: src/lib/components/CommandPalette.svelte
   - Add arrangeHorizontal, arrangeVertical, arrangeGrid, etc.
2. **Wire up keyboard shortcuts** (4-6 hours)
   - Tool selection: V, R, C, E, L, T, P, S
   - Duplicate: Cmd+D
   - Layer management: Cmd+], Cmd+[, etc.
   - Arrow keys: nudge shapes
3. **Complete AI Dev Log** (1 day)
   - Required for Pass/Fail
4. **Create Demo Video** (1 day)
   - Required or -10 points

### High Value (3-5 days)

5. **Test AI complex commands** (1 day)
   - After fixing layout tools
6. **Scale testing** (1 day)
   - 500 shapes performance
   - 5 user load test
7. **Implement PNG export** (1 day)
   - Use Konva toDataURL()

## CONCLUSION

**Previous Assessment:** 75-85 points (optimistic, unverified)  
**Honest Assessment:** 51-61 points (with current bugs and gaps)  
**Realistic Target:** 70-80 points (with critical fixes + testing)  
**Stretch Goal:** 85-90 points (with full implementation)

**Critical Next Steps:**

1. Fix AI layout tools bug (MUST DO)
2. Implement missing keyboard shortcuts (MUST DO)
3. Complete AI Dev Log (REQUIRED)
4. Create Demo Video (REQUIRED)
5. Do actual testing (validates all claims)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks minimum to reach passing grade (70+)
